## Context

Monocromo was commissioned to design the visual communication strategy for a progressive candidate's electoral platform. 

The campaign required an effective communication of progressive values that would appeal to a broader electoral base. This new narrative had to be coherent with the candidate's previous trajectory as a senator. However, the campaign needed to better understand a growing user base.

For this project, I worked with the director of the Design agency and the candidate's political strategists.

## Research Activities

My work consisted on:

- Synthesising 100+ page raw speeches, refining them into a machine-readable dataset for further research and analysis.
- Producing user profiles for the users that were addressed in the speeches and mapping 'absent personas' that could potentially be addressed but had not been yet considered. This inverse mapping provided insights and indicated pain points that required urgent attention.
- Interpreting results and synthesising pain points for key stakeholders, supporting strategy with actionable indicators.
